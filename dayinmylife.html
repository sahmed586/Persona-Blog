<p> What we do on a day to day basis is something that is often times overlooked, when in reality, each day is 
a building block of how we picture our overall "life". That being said, <strong>it is extremely important to spend 
each day wisely and allocate our time towards things that matter to us.</strong> <br><br>

The following is a rough skeleton of how I aim to go through a typical weekday. </p>

<ul id="routine list">
	<li> <span class: "routine"> Wake up before sunrise for prayer.</span> </li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Afterwards, I usually go back to sleep, depending on work load and energy I may stay up. </li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Wake up again in a few hours to complete my rest.</span> </li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Eat a healthy breakfast while watching lectures and taking notes.</span> </li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Go to the gym (every other day). The days I don't go I tend to complete any chores I have. </li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Typically second prayer of the day.</span></li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Lunch time!</span></li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Post Lunch is when I do some last minute preparation for quizzes and exams. 
	<li> <span class: "routine">Third prayer of the day.</span></li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Complete any quizzes exams. This is also when I finally get to spend time with my family once 
	everyone is at home together.</span></li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Fourth prayer of the day.</span></li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Dinner together with the family.</span></li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Final prayer of the day.</span></li>
	<li> <span class: "routine">Self care time and unwinding for the night!</span></li>

</ul>

<br>


<p> However, on the weekends, my schedule looks a little different because it includes my work schedule. Currently I am 
working at a dress boutique at a local mall. The following is my schedule on a work day, which is normally on the weekends. </p> 
<ul>
	<li>Aim to wake up for sunrise time prayer. </span></li>
	<li>Go back to sleep to make sure I am well rested for the day. </span></li>
	<li>Wake up again at 10:30 am and start preparing myself for the day. </span></li>
	<li>At about 11 am I try to eat a full balanced breakfast to carry me through the rest of the day.</span></li>
	<li>I then get myself dressed in whatever I want to wear and do my makeup. </span></li>
	<li>After this I pack myself a small snack for later in the day and water. </span></li>
	<li>Head out of my house at approvimately 11:30am so I can arrive to my shift 10 minutes early.</span></li>
	<li>My shift starts at noon, so I work from then on helping customers find the dresses they are looking for as well 
	as maintain a clean and safe environment. </span></li>
	<li>My shift ends approximately at 7, so I then head home and typically clean up and shower.</span></li>
	<li>My plan for the rest of the day is either to spend time with family, or take care of school work dpending on
	my workload that week.</span></li>
</ul><br><br>

The following is a time lapse of one of my tasks while working at the store, which is to put dresses up on mannequins for the displays. <br><br>

<br><br><pr><small><b>Disclaimer: Listed is an <em>ideal</em> daily routine. Not every single day is picture perfect.</b></small></p>

<p>Often times things get in the way and we go through our ups and downs that don't always allow us to complete all that we would like to 
do on any given day. Just like today <time>June 1st, 2021</time>, I was not able to follow this schedule exactlty. Lack of motivation is 
something that I struggle with in waves every now and then and it makes it very difficult to 
complete daily tasks. But as stated by Winston Churchill: </p>

<blockquote> 
<p> <q>A <b>pessimist</b> sees diffculty in every opportunity. The <b>optimist</b> sees the opportunity in every difficulty. </q></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is so easy to get caught up in the struggle and view things from a negative perspective especially with how much 
our society has changed within this past year due to the pandemic, as stated in Forbes Magazine Article <cite> The Pandemic 
Has Created A New Kind Of Burnout Which Makes Well-Being More Critical Than Ever</cite> by Naz Beheshti. <br><br>
However, in the end it is so important to remind yourself that there
is a beauty behind the struggle. It is a lot easier to say than to believe it, especially during difficult times but glimpses of <b>optimism</b> -
<defn><i>hopefulness and condifence about the future</i></defn>, can go a long way.
