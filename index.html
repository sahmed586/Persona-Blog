<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>"I am a 19 year old student who is pursuing a major in Computer Science, at Wayne State 
University," is probably one of the most OVERPLAYED introductions in today's history. So, I will be changing things
up and providing a glimpse of who I, Sadia Ahmed, am through some of my random thoughts. </p>

<h2>Beneath The Surface</h2>
<p> Understanding who we are is one of the most tedious challenges life has to throw at us. One would expect
it to be a lot easier given you are living as yourself 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
But at the end of the day, what makes us who we are is a combination of so many different things.<br><br>
I am my dreams and aspirations, worries and doubts, happiness, and motivation. I am my accomplishments and I am my failures. I am a walking 
reflection of those who have been in my life, and the experiences I have lived thus far. 
As students it can become so easy to lose sight of who we are, as we are often viewed as numbers, scores, GPAs.
Through all of the identity crises we may face during this transitional period of our lives, 
I've understood that we are truly never alone in our struggles.

<br><br> Sonder (<em>noun.</em>) - the realization that everyone else has a life that is just as complex as
one's own. Often times we become so indulged in our own livelihods and responsibilities,
that we forget there is always more than what meets the eye when it comes to others. </p>

<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
<p>The point of elaborating on all of this is to highlight one of my greatest understandings of
life thus far - struggle is what builds our character. Sometimes we need to lose sight of who we are just to 
to fully develop our true selves. Furthermore, these challenging times can be worked through with an <em>open-mind</em> 
and a <em>kind heart</em>. Though we have our own struggles and never understand the the full extent of each others' livelihoods, 
we know that there is much more that lies beneath <em>just</em> another college student who is pursuing <em>just</em> another degree.
My name is Sadia Ahmed and I am much MORE than a 19 year old student majoring in Computer Science at Wayne State. </p>

college classes and self care while the weekend revolves around work, social life, and potentially balancing more school work depending on
